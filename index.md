# Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the enhanced Methuselah‑prediction
pipeline.  These pages provide context, tutorials and background
material to help you run and extend the project.  The documentation is
organised as a Jupyter Book: each page is a Markdown file or Jupyter
notebook.  You can build the book locally with:

```bash
jupyter-book build docs
```

## Contents

- **Introduction:** overview of chronological lifespan experiments in
  yeast and motivation for predictive modelling.
- **Quick start:** step‑by‑step guide to preparing data, training
  models and interpreting results.
- **Advanced models:** conceptual introduction to survival analysis,
  graph neural networks and transformers in the context of CLS.
- **Reproducibility:** instructions for using Snakemake, DVC and
  containerisation to ensure reproducible research.
- **Ethics:** discussion of the limitations of extrapolating from
  yeast to humans and responsible communication of longevity research.
